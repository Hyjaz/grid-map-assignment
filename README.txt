COMP 345 Assignment 2 - Map-Observer - Arnaud Songa-Cote (26899185)
****************************************************

SET UP:
It is a simple C++ console program, simply create a project and import the src and tests folders.
For simplycity, tests are ran at the beginning of the project's main function if the RUN_TESTS preprocessor is defined (which is the case by default). Failed tests will make the program exit.

ASSIGNMENT 2 TESTS:
2 tests were added to the test suite from assignment 1. They test the map observer implementation and consist of:
    - testAttachMapObserver
    - testDetachMapObserver
